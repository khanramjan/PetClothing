4. **Type-Safe Store**: Full TypeScript support prevents runtime errors
5. **Vite Environment Setup**: Proper typing for env variables without `any` casting

## 📝 Code Quality

- ✅ No TypeScript errors
- ✅ ESLint configured with reasonable rules
- ✅ Proper type definitions throughout
- ✅ Error handling with try/catch
- ✅ Loading states for async operations
- ✅ Clean component structure with composition

## 🔗 Connected Systems
