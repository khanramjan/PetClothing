# SSLCommerz Fix - Quick Start Guide (5 Minutes)

## The Problem in One Sentence
You were building a fake sessionkey instead of asking SSLCommerz for a real one → SSLCommerz rejected it → 404 error.

## The Solution in One Sentence
Call SSLCommerz API to get a valid sessionkey → Use that sessionkey → Payment page loads ✅

---

## What Changed (The Code)

### ❌ OLD CODE (BROKEN)
```csharp
// Just manually build a string and hope SSLCommerz accepts it
var sessionKey = $"{storeId}|{transactionId}|{request.Amount}|{request.Currency}|{userId}";
var gatewayUrl = $"{cashierUrl}?sessionkey={Uri.EscapeDataString(sessionKey)}";
// Result: 404 NOT FOUND
```

### ✅ NEW CODE (FIXED)
```csharp
// Ask SSLCommerz API for a valid sessionkey
var response = await httpClient.PostAsync(apiUrl, formContent);
var sslResponse = JsonSerializer.Deserialize<SSLCommerzSessionResponse>(responseContent);
var gatewayUrl = $"{cashierUrl}?sessionkey={Uri.EscapeDataString(sslResponse.sessionkey)}";
// Result: ✅ Payment page loads
```

## What Files Changed

| File | What | Why |
|------|------|-----|
| `PaymentDTOs.cs` | Added 2 new DTOs | To match SSLCommerz API format |
| `IServices.cs` | Added 1 method | To declare the new service method |
| `PaymentService.cs` | Added 2 methods | To implement SSLCommerz API call |
| `PaymentsController.cs` | Changed 1 method | To use service instead of manual URL |

**Total: 4 files, ~150 lines of new code**

## Quick Test (2 Minutes)

### 1. Start Your API
```powershell
cd backend
dotnet run
```

### 2. Send a Test Request
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/payments/initiate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "amount": 152.99,
    "currency": "BDT",
    "orderId": "12345",
    "customerName": "Test User",
    "customerEmail": "test@example.com",
    "customerPhone": "+8801234567890",
    "description": "Test Payment",
    "successUrl": "https://example.com/success",
    "failUrl": "https://example.com/fail",
    "cancelUrl": "https://example.com/cancel"
  }'
```

### 3. Expected Response
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "transactionId": "ORDER-20251029060001-ABC123",
    "gatewayPageURL": "https://sandbox.sslcommerz.com/gwprocess/v4/cashier.php?sessionkey=khani68f514d22504a%7CORDER-20251029...",
    "message": "Payment gateway URL generated successfully"
  }
}
```

### 4. Visit the URL
Copy the `gatewayPageURL` and open it in browser.

**Before Fix:** ❌ 404 Error - "The requested URL was not found"
**After Fix:** ✅ SSLCommerz Payment Page loads successfully

---

## Configuration (1 Minute)

### Make Sure You Have

**Option A: In appsettings.json**
```json
{
  "SSLCommerz": {
    "StoreId": "testbox",
    "StorePassword": "qwerty",
    "ApiUrl": "https://sandbox.sslcommerz.com/gwprocess/v4/api.php",
    "CashierUrl": "https://sandbox.sslcommerz.com/gwprocess/v4/cashier.php"
  }
}
```

**Option B: Environment Variables**
```powershell
$env:SSLCOMMERZ_STORE_ID = "testbox"
$env:SSLCOMMERZ_STORE_PASSWORD = "qwerty"
```

That's it! The API URLs default to sandbox if not specified.

## Verify It Works (1 Minute)

### Checklist
- [ ] Application builds: `dotnet build`
- [ ] Application runs: `dotnet run`
- [ ] Endpoint responds to POST `/api/payments/initiate`
- [ ] Response includes `gatewayPageURL`
- [ ] URL loads in browser WITHOUT 404
- [ ] SSLCommerz payment form visible

If all checkmarks are ✅, you're done!

## Common Issues & Fixes

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Still getting 404 | Check credentials, verify API response in logs |
| "Credentials not configured" error | Set SSLCOMMERZ_STORE_ID and SSLCOMMERZ_STORE_PASSWORD env vars |
| Empty response | Check network connectivity to sandbox.sslcommerz.com |
| Build errors | Make sure you have System.Net.Http and System.Text.Json imports |

---

## Next Steps

1. ✅ **Verify** - Test the endpoint works
2. ✅ **Integrate** - Update frontend to use new endpoint
3. ✅ **Test** - Complete full payment flow
4. ✅ **Deploy** - Move to staging/production
5. ✅ **Monitor** - Watch for errors in logs

---

## That's It!

You've successfully:
- ❌ Eliminated the 404 error
- ✅ Implemented proper SSLCommerz API communication
- ✅ Fixed the payment gateway integration

The rest of the payment flow (callbacks, verification, etc.) can be implemented in the next phase.
