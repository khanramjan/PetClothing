# OAuth User Sync Implementation

## ✅ What Was Added

### Backend Changes

1. **New DTO** (`SyncOAuthUserRequest` in `AuthDTOs.cs`):
   - Captures OAuth user data (email, name, provider)
   - Used to sync OAuth users to database

2. **New API Endpoint** (`/api/auth/sync-oauth-user`):
   - Accepts OAuth user data from frontend
   - Creates or updates user in database
   - Returns internal JWT tokens for the user

3. **New Service Method** (`SyncOAuthUserAsync` in `AuthService`):
   - Checks if user exists by email
   - Creates new user if doesn't exist (with empty password)
   - Updates existing user's last login time
   - Generates and returns JWT tokens

### Frontend Changes

1. **Enhanced SupabaseAuthListener**:
   - Detects when user signs in with OAuth
   - Automatically calls `/api/auth/sync-oauth-user`
   - Syncs user data to backend database
   - Updates auth store with internal JWT tokens
   - Shows success/error toast notifications

## 🔄 How It Works

1. User clicks "Continue with Google"
2. Supabase handles OAuth flow
3. User signs in with Google
4. Supabase redirects back to app
5. `SupabaseAuthListener` detects sign-in
6. **Frontend automatically calls `/api/auth/sync-oauth-user`**
7. **Backend creates/updates user in database**
8. Backend returns internal JWT tokens
9. Frontend stores both Supabase JWT and internal JWT
10. User is now tracked in your database! ✅

## 📊 User Tracking

OAuth users are now saved in your `users` table with:
- ✅ Email
- ✅ First Name & Last Name (from Google)
- ✅ Role (Customer)
- ✅ Created At timestamp
- ✅ Last Login At timestamp
- ✅ Empty password (they use OAuth)

You can now:
- View OAuth users in your database
- Track their orders
- Send them notifications
- Apply role-based access control
- See when they last logged in

## 🧪 Testing

1. **Start backend and frontend**
2. **Click "Continue with Google"**
3. **Sign in with Google account**
4. **Check your database** - user should appear in `users` table!
5. **Check browser console** - should see success message
6. **Try accessing protected routes** - should work!

## 🔍 Database Check

```sql
-- View all OAuth users
SELECT id, email, first_name, last_name, role, created_at, last_login_at 
FROM users 
WHERE password_hash = '';
```

OAuth users will have empty `password_hash` since they authenticate through Google.

**Now your OAuth users are tracked and stored in your database!** 🎉
