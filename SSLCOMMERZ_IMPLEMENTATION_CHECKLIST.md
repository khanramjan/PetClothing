## Before You Deploy - Pre-Deployment Checklist

### Configuration
- [ ] SSLCommerz Store ID configured (testbox for sandbox)
- [ ] SSLCommerz Store Password configured (qwerty for sandbox)
- [ ] API URL correct: `https://sandbox.sslcommerz.com/gwprocess/v4/api.php`
- [ ] Cashier URL correct: `https://sandbox.sslcommerz.com/gwprocess/v4/cashier.php`
- [ ] Credentials stored in appsettings.json OR environment variables

### Code Review
- [ ] Reviewed `InitiateSSLCommerzPaymentAsync()` method
- [ ] Confirmed HTTP client call to SSLCommerz API
- [ ] Verified sessionkey extraction from response
- [ ] Checked error handling and logging
- [ ] Validated input parameters

### Testing
- [ ] Application builds successfully (`dotnet build`)
- [ ] No compilation errors or warnings
- [ ] Application starts without crashes (`dotnet run`)
- [ ] API endpoint responds to requests
- [ ] Error validation works (missing fields, invalid amounts)

---

## Local Testing Checklist

### Step 1: Setup
- [ ] Navigate to backend directory
- [ ] Ensure credentials are configured
- [ ] Start the application

```powershell
cd backend
dotnet run --project PetClothingShop.API/PetClothingShop.API.csproj
```

### Step 2: Test Valid Request
- [ ] Use cURL or Postman to send request
- [ ] Provide all required fields (name, email, amount, etc)
- [ ] Receive HTTP 200 OK response
- [ ] Response contains `gatewayPageURL`

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/payments/initiate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"amount":152.99,"currency":"BDT","orderId":"1","customerName":"Test","customerEmail":"test@test.com","customerPhone":"+8801234567890","description":"Test"}'
```

### Step 3: Verify Sessionkey
- [ ] Copy `gatewayPageURL` from response
- [ ] Visit URL in web browser
- [ ] **NOT 404 error** - payment page should load
- [ ] SSLCommerz payment form visible
- [ ] Payment page is responsive

### Step 4: Test Invalid Requests
- [ ] Test missing customer name → Should fail
- [ ] Test missing email → Should fail
- [ ] Test zero amount → Should fail
- [ ] Test negative amount → Should fail
- [ ] All should return 400 with proper error message

### Step 5: Check Logs
- [ ] Look for "Initiating SSLCommerz payment" message
- [ ] Look for "SSLCommerz API response" message
- [ ] Look for "SSLCommerz session created successfully" message
- [ ] No error messages in logs

---

## Integration Testing Checklist

### Frontend Integration
- [ ] Frontend calls `/api/payments/initiate` endpoint
- [ ] Frontend passes all required parameters
- [ ] Frontend receives success response
- [ ] Frontend redirects to `gatewayPageURL`
- [ ] Payment page loads in new window/tab/same window

### Payment Flow
- [ ] User can access payment form
- [ ] User can enter card details (if testing with test cards)
- [ ] User can submit payment
- [ ] Payment processes or returns to success/fail URL
- [ ] Order status updates in database

### Error Scenarios
- [ ] Invalid credentials → Clear error message
- [ ] Network error → Clear error message
- [ ] Malformed request → 400 Bad Request
- [ ] Missing fields → 400 Bad Request with validation message

---

## Post-Deployment Checklist

### Production Preparation
- [ ] Update to production credentials when ready
- [ ] Update API URLs to production endpoints
- [ ] Test with real merchant account
- [ ] Verify payment notifications/callbacks work
- [ ] Setup callback URL handlers

### Monitoring
- [ ] Setup application logging
- [ ] Monitor for failed payment requests
- [ ] Track error rates
- [ ] Setup alerts for failures

### Security
- [ ] Credentials not exposed in logs
- [ ] Credentials only in environment variables
- [ ] HTTPS used for all communications
- [ ] Transaction IDs are unique
- [ ] Payment data validated before sending

---

## Rollback Plan (If Needed)

If you need to rollback to the old implementation:

1. Revert the 4 modified files
2. Remove the new DTOs from PaymentDTOs.cs
3. Comment out the new method from IPaymentService
4. Remove InitiateSSLCommerzPaymentAsync from PaymentService
5. Revert PaymentsController to old implementation

**Note:** This would restore the 404 error - the old implementation is broken.

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue: Still Getting 404
**Solution:**
1. Check credentials are configured
2. Verify API URL is correct
3. Check logs for SSLCommerz API response
4. Ensure sessionkey is in response

### Issue: API Returns 500 Error
**Solution:**
1. Check SSLCommerz credentials are correct
2. Verify network connectivity to SSLCommerz
3. Check all required fields are provided
4. Check logs for detailed error message

### Issue: Response Doesn't Contain gatewayPageURL
**Solution:**
1. Verify SSLCommerz API returned success status
2. Check response format (JSON vs form-encoded)
3. Verify sessionkey is being extracted
4. Check logs for parsing errors

### Issue: Payment Page Shows Blank/Error
**Solution:**
1. Verify URL is correct
2. Verify sessionkey is in URL
3. Verify URL is not 404
4. Try in different browser
5. Check browser console for errors
