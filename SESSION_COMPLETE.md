## 💻 How It Works

### Payment Flow
```
1. Customer adds items to cart
   ↓
2. Customer goes to checkout
   ↓
3. Backend creates Payment Intent
   POST /api/payments/create-intent
   Response: { clientSecret, paymentIntentId }
   ↓
4. Frontend displays Stripe payment form
   (Stripe Elements collects card)
   ↓
5. Customer clicks "Pay Now"
   ↓
6. Backend confirms payment
   POST /api/payments/confirm
   Response: { status: "succeeded" }
   ↓
7. Order status → "Processing"
   ↓
8. Stripe sends webhook → payment_intent.succeeded
   ↓
9. Backend processes order fulfillment
```
