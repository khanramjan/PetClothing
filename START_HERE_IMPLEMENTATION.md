## ⚠️ WARNING

```
1 day delay:    -$50-150 in potential sales
1 week delay:   -$350-1,050 in sales
1 month delay:  -$1,500-4,500 in sales
```

Start Monday. Seriously.

## 🚀 YOUR DECISION

**Option A: START NOW** ⭐ RECOMMENDED

- Revenue by Week 3
- $100,000+ in Year 1

**Option B: KEEP WAITING** ❌ BAD IDEA

## ✨ FINAL WORDS

You're at a crossroads.

Your project is:
- ✅ Architecturally sound

But it's:
