## 💡 Pro Tips for Implementation

### 1. Install Dependencies Early
```powershell
cd backend/PetClothingShop.API
dotnet add package SendGrid
dotnet add package iTextSharp  # for PDF later
```

### 2. Use Test Data
```csharp
// Add test coupon in seed data
var testCoupon = new Coupon 
{ 
    Code = "TEST10", 
    DiscountPercentage = 10m,
    ExpiryDate = DateTime.UtcNow.AddMonths(1)
};
```

### 3. Test Each Component Independently
- Test CouponService alone
- Test TaxService alone
- Test ShippingService alone
- Then test CheckoutService with all together

### 4. Frontend Testing
```bash
# Test checkout page loads
npm run dev

# Test API calls
# Check browser DevTools Network tab
```

### 5. Staging Environment
- Deploy to staging before production
- Test with real Stripe keys (test mode)
- Load test with multiple concurrent checkouts
- Monitor error logs

## 📞 FAQ

### Q: How long will Phase 1 take?
**A:** 5-7 days of focused development (40-50 hours of work)

### Q: What if I get stuck?
**A:** Refer to the specific document:
- Compilation error? → PHASE_1_IMPLEMENTATION_CODE.md
- API endpoint not working? → PHASE_1_CHECKLIST.md (Controller section)
- Frontend not connecting? → Frontend section of PHASE_1_CHECKLIST.md

### Q: Can I skip any tasks?
**A:** No - all Phase 1 tasks are critical:
- Checkout UI → Can't process orders without it
- Coupons → Revenue loss without discounts
- Taxes → Legal/compliance issues
- Shipping → Can't fulfill orders
- Email → No customer communication

### Q: What if something breaks?
**A:** Phase back up one day:
- Day 1-2 broke? Re-do database migrations
- Day 3-4 broke? Re-do repositories/services
- Day 5-6 broke? Re-do frontend components
- Day 7 broke? Run full testing again
