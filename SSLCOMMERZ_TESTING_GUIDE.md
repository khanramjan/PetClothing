## üîß Backend Configuration

- Store Credentials: TO BE ADDED
- Mode: SANDBOX (test mode)
```

### To Use Real Credentials:
Edit `appsettings.json`:
```json
{
  "SSLCommerz": {
    "StoreId": "your_store_id",
    "StorePassword": "your_store_password",
    "IsProduction": false
  }
}
```

## üì± UI Flow Verification

### Checkout Page Elements to Check:
```
‚úÖ Progress indicator (1/2/3/4)
‚úÖ Form fields with validation
‚úÖ Error messages on invalid input
‚úÖ Next/Previous buttons
‚úÖ Order summary sidebar (sticky)
‚úÖ Real-time total calculations
‚úÖ Radio button styling for shipping
‚úÖ Payment method information
```

### Cart Page Elements:
```
‚úÖ Product images
‚úÖ Product names and quantities
‚úÖ Unit prices and line totals
‚úÖ Quantity increment/decrement
‚úÖ Remove item button
‚úÖ Subtotal, tax, shipping calculation
‚úÖ Order summary
‚úÖ "Proceed to Checkout" button
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Unauthorized" error
- **Solution**: Make sure you're logged in before going to checkout
- Test credentials: Use Register page to create test account

### Issue: Cart items showing blank
- **Solution**: The API returns `productName` not `name`. This is already fixed in our code.

### Issue: Payment gateway not loading
- **Solution**: Check if backend endpoint is returning the gateway URL correctly
- Test endpoint: `curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/payments/initiate -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"`

### Issue: Checkout redirecting to login
- **Solution**: Auth check uses `useAuthStore().isAuthenticated`. Make sure you're authenticated.

### Issue: Total calculation wrong
- **Solution**: Verify in order summary sidebar:
  - Subtotal = sum of (price √ó quantity)
  - Tax = subtotal √ó 0.10
  - Shipping = selected method cost
  - Total = subtotal + tax + shipping

## üéØ Key Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Auth | Purpose |
|--------|----------|------|---------|
| POST | `/api/payments/initiate` | ‚úÖ Bearer token | Create SSLCommerz payment session |
| GET | `/checkout/success` | ‚ùå Public | Payment success callback |
| GET | `/checkout/failed` | ‚ùå Public | Payment failure callback |

## üìù Notes

- SSLCommerz test mode doesn't actually charge cards
- All transactions are test transactions
- Use sandbox credentials provided
- Success/failure URLs must be valid domain URLs (localhost works in sandbox)
- Transaction IDs include order ID and timestamp for tracking
- Cart is automatically cleared on successful payment
- Failed payments preserve cart for retry

## üîê Security Considerations

- Payment endpoint requires authentication (bearer token)
- Customer info validated before sending to SSLCommerz
- Transaction IDs include order identifier for tracking
- Success/fail pages are public (for callback redirects)
- Production: Add HTTPS, store validation, webhook verification
